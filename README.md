#### Description:
The Children's Bank of Canada project is a Python-based banking application that provides users with a secure and interactive interface to manage their accounts. The project features a GUI created using `tkinter` and integrates SQLite for database management. It includes functionality for user registration, authentication, balance management, and transaction history tracking.

### Features:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Login with a user ID and password.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using SHA-256.

2. **Account Management**:
   - Create new accounts with unique user IDs.
   - Reset forgotten passwords securely.

3. **Transaction System**:
   - Deposit and withdraw funds.
   - View detailed transaction history.

4. **Database Integration**:
   - SQLite is used to store user information and transaction records.
   - Includes two tables: `users` and `transactions`.

5. **Testing**:
   - Core functions are tested using `pytest`.
   - A test database ensures isolation of test data.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2. Install required libraries (if any).
3. Run `main.py` to start the application.
4. Use the GUI to interact with the banking system.

### Acknowledgments:
This proacject was developed as part of the CS50P course to demonstrate Python programming skills with a focus on GUI design, database management, and software testing.
